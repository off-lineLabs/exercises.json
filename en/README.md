# English Exercises Compilation

This folder contains the compiled version of all exercises in English.

## File

- `exercises.json` - A single JSON file containing all exercises from the repository combined into one array.

## Generation

This file is automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow "Compile Exercises" which can be triggered manually from the Actions tab.

The workflow:
1. Runs the `npm run build:json` script to compile all individual exercise.json files
2. Moves the compiled file to this `en/` folder
3. Commits and pushes the changes back to the repository
4. Also uploads the file as an artifact for download

## Format

The JSON file has the following structure:
```json
{
  "exercises": [
    {
      "name": "Exercise Name",
      "force": "push|pull",
      "level": "beginner|intermediate|expert",
      "mechanic": "compound|isolation",
      "equipment": "equipment type",
      "primaryMuscles": ["muscle1", "muscle2"],
      "secondaryMuscles": ["muscle3"],
      "instructions": ["step1", "step2"],
      "category": "strength|stretching|cardio|etc"
    }
  ]
}
```
